# 🚀 Simple-JS-Test-Library 📚
📝 Homework Assignment #5

## 📃 Details:

Create a new empty repository with a /test folder 📁, and an /app folder 📂.

Inside of the app folder, create a library (lib.js) 📚 and fill it with simple functions. These can serve any purpose you wish, such as generating a random number 🎲, or checking whether or not a string is a palindrome. Really, any kind of functions will do.

Inside the /test folder, create a simple test runner 🏃‍♀️, and then write tests for the functions in your lib.js file. You should try to test that they return (or callback) the correct value when passed valid parameters ✔️, and that they return a predictable value (and don't crash) when passed invalid parameters ❌.
